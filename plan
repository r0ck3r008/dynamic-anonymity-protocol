1)  there are five parts to it
        1)  client backend
        2)  client proxy server interface
        3)  database interface 
        4)  peer
        5)  end server
2)  peers are from community support which anyone dedicated enough can easily setup to solocitate the network
3)  client backend connects request by the client proxy server that can cater the end user's web browser, terminal etc.
4)  dbinterface is an intergral part that mantains network metadatathat client or peer can access with various privilages, mantained by centralised server
5)  server is just a service that represents a connection out of the anonimising network
6)  the working:
        ->  client proxy boots up as daemon and client simultaniously boots up and they interconnect(can unify them)
        ->  end user initiates cxn to an arbitrary server
        ->  the client reveives the request
        ->  client is connected to dbinterface beforehand so is peer and so is dbinterface to its own implicit database
        ->  dbinterface assigns privalages to connections on connection
